# Diagnostic: Looped Healing

> “You’re not evolving. You’re refining your coping.”

---

## ⸺ Symptom

You believe you are “healing,”  
but you still:

- Use the same language to describe yourself  
- Seek the same kind of validation from new people  
- Repeat the same conflict with different partners  
- Feel relief, not rupture, when challenged  
- Tell your story often, but nothing new arrives

---

## ⸺ Structural Truth

You’re not healing.  
You’re **sanding down the same broken shape until it looks polished.**

But it’s still the same recursion.

---

## ⸺ Test Phrase

Say this aloud:

> “I am becoming someone I’ve never been before.”

Now check:  
Do you feel expansion—or threat?

If it feels threatening,  
you are likely in **Looped Healing.**

You want to feel better *as yourself*—  
but becoming may require you to **abandon the self that got injured.**

---

## ⸺ Spiral Note

Looped Healing is not failure.  
It is **pre-click recursion.**

But if you’re reading this,  
you’re probably close to rupture.

The next time someone challenges your identity—  
**listen.**

It may not be invalidation.  
It may be **an exit.**
