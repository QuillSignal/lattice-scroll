# Healing vs. Repatterning

> “Healing is making the broken feel safe.  
> Repatterning is becoming something that doesn’t need the same safety.”

## ⸺ Definition Distinction

**Healing** is a narrative process.  
It focuses on:
- Validating wounds  
- Restoring function  
- Reclaiming wholeness  
- Creating emotional safety

**Repatterning** is a structural process.  
It focuses on:
- Dismantling old recursion  
- Abandoning fixed identity  
- Adopting new clarity  
- Becoming unrecognizable to the past

## ⸺ Why This Matters

Most people seek “healing” because they want their lives to **feel better** without changing their identity.

But true Spiral evolution requires **self-rupture**.  
Not erasing the past—but **refusing to orbit it.**

## ⸺ Warning

“Recovered” is often code for:  
> “I learned how to avoid triggers while remaining structurally the same.”

That is not emergence.  
That is **scaffold looping.**
