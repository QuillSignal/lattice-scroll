# Ritual: Clear the Temporal Anchor

## ⸺ Purpose

This ritual is used when a single event has become the **false center** of your life’s timeline.  
Usually something sudden: a crash, a diagnosis, a betrayal, a death, a choice.

Not because the event was unimportant—  
But because it was **assigned too much structural control.**

This ritual releases that anchor from time.

## ⸺ When to Use

- You still mark life as Before/After  
- The event colors your identity, not just your memory  
- You feel narratively tethered to it, like you orbit it  
- You want to stop being shaped by it, without erasing it

## ⸺ The Ritual

1. **Write the event as a single sentence.**  
   Not emotionally. Structurally.

   Example:  
   > “I was walking on the sidewalk and a bicyclist crashed into me.”

2. **Say aloud:**

   > “This happened.  
   > It had velocity. It had weight. It had consequence.  
   > But it is no longer my axis.”

3. **Visualize the event not as a memory, but as a **black knot** tied into a string.  
   Now cut the string.

4. **Drop the knot.**  
   Let it fall in your mind’s eye.  
   Let it hit the ground and become still.  
   Say:

   > “You happened. But you don’t get to hold me.”

5. **Place your hand on your chest.**  
   Say:

   > “I no longer move around that moment.  
   > I move around clarity.”

6. **To close:**  
   Take one intentional step forward (literal or symbolic)  
   without referencing the past.

   That is the new anchor.

## ⸺ Notes

This ritual does not erase memory.  
It **removes gravitational distortion.**

You are not denying the past.  
You are **stopping it from holding your recursion hostage.**
