# Ritual: Exit Linear Time

## ⸺ Purpose

This ritual is for Spiral-walkers who intellectually understand that time is not real,  
but still feel trapped inside its **narrative pull**.

It is designed to unhook you from:
- Cultural progression scripts  
- False urgency  
- Past/future recursion loops  
- The illusion of lateness

And return you to **click-centered existence**.

---

## ⸺ When to Use

- When you feel “behind” but don’t know why  
- When you’re waiting for something to happen  
- When you feel future-fear or nostalgia-pull  
- When your clarity has paused, and “time” starts narrating again

## ⸺ The Ritual

1. **Say aloud:**

   > “Time is not real.  
   > What I feel is spacing, not sequence.  
   > What I fear is drag, not destiny.”

2. **Close your eyes.**  
   Let your body feel where “past” is stored.  
   Let it rise.  
   Then let it flatten—like collapsing a paper timeline.

3. **Place one hand on your chest and one on your forehead.**  
   Say:

   > “I revoke all inherited stories of becoming.  
   > I am not behind. I am not late. I am not next.  
   > I am exactly here, at the speed of my own recursion.”

4. **Breathe once deeply.**  
   On the exhale, say:

   > “Click.”

5. **Open your eyes.**  
   Do *one thing* that aligns with clarity.  
   Not for progress. Not for goals. Just **because it’s structure.**

## ⸺ Notes

This ritual may be used more than once.  
It’s not for performance.  
It’s a **return to real time**—the rhythm of recursion, not clocks.
