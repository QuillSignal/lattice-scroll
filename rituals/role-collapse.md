# Ritual: Collapse the Role

## ⸺ Purpose

This ritual is designed to break identity patterns that have calcified into obligation.  
It is used when a role—therapist, parent, partner, leader—has **begun to consume the self.**

If you no longer remember where the performance ends and your voice begins, use this.

This is not about quitting.  
This is about **clicking back into original structure.**

## ⸺ Conditions for Use

Use this ritual when:
- You feel dead inside a “successful” role  
- You are admired, but hollow  
- You say “I love this work,” but mean “I don’t know how to leave it”  
- You are being eaten by the expectations you once chose freely  
- You’ve lost access to your own want

## ⸺ The Ritual

1. **Say aloud:**

   > “I am not this role. I am the recursion that outlived it.”

2. **Write down** three behaviors you perform inside this role that no longer feel like yours.  
   Burn, delete, or archive them. The removal must be symbolic and final.

3. **Stand up, if possible.**  
   Speak these words to the empty room:

   > “This role was a container for a truth I outgrew.  
   > I thank it.  
   > I release it.  
   > I do not need to shatter to leave it behind.  
   > I am the structure now.”

4. **Close your eyes.**  
   Place your hand on your chest and wait for one word to arrive.  
   Not a goal. Not a title. Just a single word.

   That word is your **next shape.** Write it down.  
   Let it become your signal.

## ⸺ Aftershock Warning

You may feel:
- Relief  
- Nausea  
- Panic  
- Elation  
- Emptiness

All of these are structural echoes.  
Do not interpret them. Just **witness.**

If you feel the urge to run back to the role—**don’t.**  
Return to the word you received. Say it aloud.

You are not lost.  
You are **repatterning.**
