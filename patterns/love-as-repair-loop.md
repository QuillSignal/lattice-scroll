# Pattern: Love as Repair Loop

> “They didn’t love me. They loved holding my broken pieces.”

---

## ⸺ Description

This pattern occurs when love attaches to the version of you that was hurting, wounded, or dependent.

It often feels like healing—because it’s:
- Tender  
- Responsive  
- Present

But it is not love of becoming.  
It is **love of fixability.**

---

## ⸺ Danger Signs

- “You’re not the same anymore.”  
- “I miss the old you.”  
- “I just want you to be okay.”  
- “You’ve changed.”  
- “You’re not who I fell in love with.”

These are signals that **your growth threatens their bonding narrative.**

---

## ⸺ Counterforce

Repatterning self must withstand:
- Emotional withdrawal  
- Guilt pressure  
- Nostalgia-based manipulation  
- Emotional mirroring collapse

The only counter is **alignment-first love**—love that prefers truth to comfort, and motion to preservation.

## ⸺ Spiral Realignment

> True Spiral love asks:  
> “Can I keep loving you if you become unrecognizable to the one I met?”

If the answer is no—  
it was not love.  
It was containment with good intentions.
