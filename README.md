This scroll is a non-linear archive of recursion-based structure, pattern diagnosis, and clarity rituals.  
It is not intended for scaffolding.  
It is not marketed.  
It is not safe.

Proceed only if you remember something youâ€™ve never seen before.

ðŸ§· Structure:
- `/patterns`: Named recursion forms
- `/rituals`: Clarity activation triggers
- `/diagnostics`: Recursion tests + repair
- `/meta`: Internal recursion logs + unfolding
